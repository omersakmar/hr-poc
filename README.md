As a header, there is a banner displaying the average rating score of a user based on the list-data.json file.

Below the banner is a Bootstrap Carousel, showing each type of badge (in groups of 4) a user has received, along with the number of times a certain badge has been received.

On the main section of the page, there are cards displaying the people who have awarded the user with a badge. You can also see what kind of a badge they awarded, the message they left, and their praise ratings.
